# JavaScript Function Practice

This repository contains JavaScript functions that are designed to practice different time complexities. There are two main problems to solve:

1. **Unique Characters in a String**
   - `isUniqueLinear(str)`: Determines if a string has all unique characters using a Set (linear time complexity).
   - `isUniqueQuadratic(str)`: Determines if a string has all unique characters without using additional data structures (quadratic time complexity).

2. **Finding the Most Frequent Element**
   - `mostFrequentLinear(arr)`: Finds the most frequent element in an array using a hash map (linear time complexity).
   - `mostFrequentLogarithmic(arr)`: Finds the most frequent element in a sorted array (logarithmic time complexity).

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-link.git
cd your-repository-name
npm install
```
## Running Tests

This project uses Jest for testing. To run the tests, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm test
The test cases are defined in the from-scratch.spec.js file. Make sure all tests pass by implementing the correct logic in the from-scratch.js functions.

## Implementing Functions

Open the from-scratch.js file and start implementing the functions. The function starters are already provided for you. Once you have implemented a function, you can run the tests to check if your implementation is correct.
